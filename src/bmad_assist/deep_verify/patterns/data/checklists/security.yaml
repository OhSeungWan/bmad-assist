# Security Boundary Analysis Checklist
# Applied when SECURITY domain is detected

checklist:
  - id: "SEC-BOUNDARY-001"
    category: "auth_bypass"
    question: "Are all authentication bypasses intentional and documented?"
    description: "Undocumented auth bypasses create critical security vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized access"
    severity_if_violated: "critical"
    domain: "security"

  - id: "SEC-BOUNDARY-002"
    category: "secret_exposure"
    question: "Are secrets (keys, tokens, passwords) properly protected from exposure?"
    description: "Secrets should not be logged, returned in errors, or exposed through debug endpoints"
    severity_if_violated: "critical"
    domain: "security"

  - id: "SEC-BOUNDARY-003"
    category: "timing_attacks"
    question: "Are sensitive operations protected against timing attacks?"
    description: "String comparison, lookup operations, and crypto operations should use constant-time algorithms"
    severity_if_violated: "error"
    domain: "security"

  - id: "SEC-BOUNDARY-004"
    category: "input_validation"
    question: "Is all user input validated before processing?"
    description: "Unvalidated input can lead to injection attacks, XSS, path traversal, and other vulnerabilities"
    severity_if_violated: "error"
    domain: "security"

  - id: "SEC-BOUNDARY-005"
    category: "privilege_escalation"
    question: "Are authorization checks enforced on all privileged operations?"
    description: "Missing authorization checks allow privilege escalation and unauthorized actions"
    severity_if_violated: "critical"
    domain: "security"

  - id: "SEC-BOUNDARY-006"
    category: "rate_limiting"
    question: "Are sensitive endpoints protected by rate limiting?"
    description: "Without rate limiting, endpoints are vulnerable to brute force, enumeration, and DoS attacks"
    severity_if_violated: "error"
    domain: "security"
