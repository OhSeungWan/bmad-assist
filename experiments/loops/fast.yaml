# NOTE: This template defines STORY-LEVEL phases only.
# Epic-level phases (retrospective, QA) are controlled by:
#   - PHASE_ORDER in core/state.py (defines full sequence)
#   - get_next_phase() in core/loop/guardian.py (skips disabled phases)
# Retrospective: ALWAYS runs after last story completes
# QA phases: ONLY when --qa flag is set (BMAD_QA_ENABLED=1)
