# Story Spec dv-050

## Overview
This is a synthetic specification artifact for Deep Verify testing.

## Implementation Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Database queries must use parameterized statements
- All API endpoints must validate input

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Response time < 100ms for 95th percentile
- Support 1000 concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can authenticate with valid credentials
2. SQL injection attempts are blocked
